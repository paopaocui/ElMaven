User Documentation
==================

Welcome to the El-MAVEN user documentation!

El-MAVEN is an open source LC-MS data processing engine that is optimal for isotopomer labeling and untargeted metabolomic profiling experiments. Currently El-MAVEN exists as a desktop application that runs on Windows, Ubuntu and MacOS. The software can be used to view the mass spectra, align chromatograms, perform peak-feature detection and alignment for labeled and unlabeled mass spectrometry data. The aim of this software package is to reduce complexity of metabolomics analysis by using a highly intuitive interface for exploring and validating metabolomics data.
